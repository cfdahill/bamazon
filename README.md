# bamazon
This assignment required the use of Node.js and MySQL databases.  In it, I created a table with product information including the name, cost, and department.  There were then two different node programs to run through the database.  The first one, bamazonCustomer.js is a customer's perspective letting you view and purchase the merchandise.  The second file, bamazonManager.js lets a manager view inventory of products, view products with low inventories, change the inventory of the products, and add new products.

This program requires node.js; mysql; and the npm packages: mysql, dotenv, and inquirer.

The following link is for a screencast of the program in use.
